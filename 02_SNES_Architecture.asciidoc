# SNES architecture

The SNES is a cartridge-based system that does not contain any operating system (OS).
In contrast, even the most basic personal computer (PC) has at least a BIOS (basic input- and output-system) which gets loaded when the device is powered on.
In case of the SNES, when the system gets powered on, it starts executing machine instructions directly from the cartridge.

The following is a (highly simplified) schematic overview of the main components inside the SNES.
