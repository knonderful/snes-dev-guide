# Introduction

The intention of this guide is to make it easier for new (aspiring) SNES developers to get started with software development.
Most existing guides cover only specific aspects of the platform.
Additionally, in most documents some expertise is expected from the reader that may not be present.
This guide attempts to establish a complete and concise documentation and presumes only basic programming experience from the outset.
